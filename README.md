# Shopping Cart

Frontend for an e-store that sells computer accessories and peripherals.  
Made with React, `create-react-app` and the Mantine UI component library.

## Todo
 - Experiment with bottom header margins, especially at small screen sizes; also button sizes
 - Add big close button to bottom of drawer
 - Make either header or cart button + indicator sticky
 - Need to add quantity form on the items in the cart Drawer component.
 - Add an indicator on ItemCard and Product page matching the count of the item currently in the cart.
